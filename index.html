            <p>Hi!</p>
            <p>I got my bachelor's degree in Economics from Central Washington University in 2011.</p> 
            <p>In November of 2011 I started working for a bank as a teller. I worked for that bank for several years and was able to become a Client Services Supervisor. In 2021 I got my MBA through WGU and was promoted to Client Services Manager.</p> 
            <p>In Septmeber of 2022 after over 10 years working Retail Banking I decided it was time for a change, quit my banking job, and enrolled in UW Coding Bootcamp.</p>
